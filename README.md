# INFO 159 Spring 2020 Projects 
My implementations of skip-gram word embedding evaluation, a transition-based dependency parser, neural coreference resolution via PyTorch, and a transformer model dialogue agent via PyTorch. These were created during the Spring 2020 iteration of David Bamman's undergraduate Natural Language Processing course at UC Berkeley.
